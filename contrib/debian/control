Package: dogecoinevd
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: peer-to-peer network based digital currency - daemon
 DogecoinEV is a free open source peer-to-peer electronic cash system that
 is completely decentralized, without the need for a central server or
 trusted parties.  Users hold the crypto keys to their own money and
 transact directly with each other, with the help of a P2P network to
 check for double-spending.
 .
 Full transaction history is stored locally at each client.  This
 requires 20+ GB of space, slowly growing.
 .
 This package provides the daemon, dogecoinevd, and the CLI tool
 dogecoinev-cli to interact with the daemon.

Package: dogecoinev-qt
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}

Package: dogecoinev-tx
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: peer-to-peer digital currency - standalone transaction tool
 DogecoinEV is a free open source peer-to-peer electronic cash system that
 is completely decentralized, without the need for a central server or
 trusted parties.  Users hold the crypto keys to their own money and
 transact directly with each other, with the help of a P2P network to
 check for double-spending.
 .
 This package provides dogecoinev-tx, a command-line transaction creation
 tool which can be used without a dogecoinev daemon.  Some means of
 exchanging minimal transaction data with peers is still required.
