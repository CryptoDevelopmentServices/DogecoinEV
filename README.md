# DEV (DogecoinEV)

## Overview

**DEV (DogecoinElonVision)** is a groundbreaking fork of Dogecoin, designed to live up to Elon Musk‚Äôs vision of a scalable, efficient, and high-throughput blockchain. By preserving Dogecoin's beloved tokenomics and mining reward structure while introducing a **10 MB block size limit**, DEV ensures enhanced performance and scalability for the future of decentralized networks.

## Key Features

### **1. Enhanced Scalability**
- **10 MB Block Size Limit**: A significant increase, allowing:
  - Higher transaction throughput.
  - Reduced network congestion.
  - Improved performance for large-scale adoption.

### **2. Familiar Tokenomics**
- DEV retains the same inflationary model as Dogecoin:
  - Unlimited supply with predictable, gradual issuance rates.
  - Designed to support tipping, microtransactions, and community engagement.

### **3. Mining Rewards**
- DEV follows Dogecoin‚Äôs reward schedule, offering fair, incentivized rewards.
- Block rewards based on the current schedule:

| **Block Range**          | **Reward Per Block (DEV)** |
|---------------------------|----------------------------|
| Block 0 to 99,999         | 500,000 (first 1k blocks random rewards up to 1m) |
| Block 100,000 to 144,999  | 250,000                   |
| Block 145,000 to 199,999  | 125,000                   |
| Block 200,000 to 299,999  | 62,500                    |
| Block 300,000 to 399,999  | 31,250                    |
| Block 400,000 to 499,999  | 15,625                    |
| Block 500,000+            | 10,000                    |

- **Block Time**: 1 minute ensuring rapid confirmations.
- DEV uses the **Scrypt algorithm**, making it compatible with existing Dogecoin mining hardware and ASIC miners.

### **Understanding the Scrypt Algorithm**
Scrypt is a memory-hard proof-of-work algorithm designed to be more resistant to ASIC mining. It requires significant memory, allowing decentralization by enabling consumer-grade hardware to mine effectively.

### **How Mining Works**
1. **Transaction Verification** ‚Äì Miners validate transactions before bundling them into a block.
2. **Block Creation** ‚Äì Verified transactions are combined into a new block.
3. **Puzzle Solving** ‚Äì Miners solve a complex puzzle by finding a suitable nonce.
4. **Block Confirmation** ‚Äì The valid block is broadcast to the network and added to the blockchain.

### **Merge Mining**
DogecoinEV supports merge mining, allowing miners to simultaneously mine DEV and other Scrypt-based cryptocurrencies, such as Litecoin, without additional computational effort. This process, known as **Auxiliary Proof of Work (AuxPoW)**, was activated at block 30,000. Merge mining enhances network security by leveraging the existing hash power of established networks like Litecoin, providing an efficient way for miners to maximize their rewards while contributing to the stability and robustness of the DogecoinEV blockchain.
